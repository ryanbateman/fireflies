# Firefly Synchronisation
##Description

An attempt at simulating how fireflies synchronise their flashes in attempt to be better seen (from afar) as a group, using Processing.  

## Background
Fireflies have terrible eyesight but evolution decided that a faint light attached to their butts was the best way for them to communicate their availability for sexy-times. In order to better communicate their availability for sexy times, they evolved to synchronise their faint butt flashes to when they were able to see another firefly nearby. The end result is that groups of fireflies syncrhonise in the wild, forming a larger, better light for distant fireflies to spot.  

This project was an attempt to explore what that may look like when simulated using Processing, and to identify the practicality of this simulation, using Processing.  

For the purposes of the firefly movement (which was kinda tangential to the whole thing), the fireflies move across a 3d plane of Perlin noise. This simulates co-ordinated movement but can end up with them being stuck for a few moments in weird local minima. There movement is a little samey as a result.

For more academic language, the paper that spiked my interest is [available here](http://math.hmc.edu/math164/2006/runyeon/finalreport.pdf).
